# ProjectTwin: ESP32 TX/RX IoT System with OLED and ThingSpeak Integration
<br>

A complete dual-node ESP32-based Internet of Things system for cloud-connected data exchange. The project implements one ESP32 as a **transmitter** (TX) that periodically sends 5 string-based values to a ThingSpeak channel, and another ESP32 as a **receiver** (RX) that fetches this data, validates network and peripheral status, and displays results on both the Serial Monitor and a 128x64 OLED screen.<br><br>
> This project was developed as part of a practical exercise during the **AICTE SAKEC IDEALAB Summer Internship Program**, reflecting core concepts of embedded systems and IoT communication.

## Note

> This implementation uses only the official `ThingSpeak` library and `WiFi.h`. No `ArduinoJson` or external data parsing is used.
> Ensure the receiver OLED is properly connected via I2C (typically SDA to GPIO 21, SCL to GPIO 22 on ESP32).
> A 15-second delay is maintained as per ThingSpeak rate limits.
> Internal blue LED on each ESP32 acts as a subtle WiFi connection indicator. On the RX node, a buzzer on GPIO 4 gives a 1s beep each time new data is received.

## System Overview

### ‚úâÔ∏è Transmitter (TX Node)

* Sends 5 randomly generated string values<br>(e.g., "https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY&field1=25.5&field2=60.3
")<br>to a ThingSpeak channel.
* Uses `ThingSpeak.writeField()` to push string data directly.
* Implements digit formatting, floating point control, and padding.
* Enforces a 15-second delay between transmissions.
* Illuminates onboard blue LED when connected to WiFi.

### üì∞ Receiver (RX Node)

* Connects to WiFi, prints connection and IP status.
* Retrieves string values from ThingSpeak using `ThingSpeak.readStringField()`.
* Checks OLED initialization and shows fallback errors.
* Displays current time, all 5 data values, and connection status on both Serial Monitor and 128x64 OLED.
* Activates a buzzer on pin 4 for 1 second upon successful data retrieval as feedback.

## Dependencies

Install via Arduino Library Manager:

```
- ThingSpeak (by MathWorks)
- Adafruit SSD1306
- Adafruit GFX
- WiFi.h (built-in with ESP32 core)
```

## ThingSpeak Setup

1. Create a ThingSpeak account.
2. Create a new channel with 5 fields.
3. Note your **WiFi SSID**, **WiFi password**, **channel ID**, **write API key**, and **read API key**.
4. Update the `.ino` files with these credentials accordingly.
